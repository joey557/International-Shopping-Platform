# International Shopping Platform
## Solution Introduction
  In the rapidly expanding realm of global e-commerce, international trade faces significant challenges in terms of efficiency, reliability, and seamless integration between various stakeholders, including wholesalers, shipping companies, and e-commerce platforms across borders.

  Our solution, the InternationalShipping Platform, addresses these challenges by offering an integrated, user-friendly digital platform that streamlines cross-border e-commerce trade. 
This platform acts as a bridge connecting domestic wholesalers with international shipping companies and foreign e-commerce platforms. 
  
  Our international shipping platform aims to build bridges between three types of companies: Shipping and delivery company, Wholesaler and e-commerce platforms. E-commerce companies can purchase the products from wholesaler companies cross-borderly and shipping companies help to transfer the goods from country to country. Our platform helps to solve the issues of communication between enterprises which means that enterprises can achieve the goal of international trading.
